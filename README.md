# Install

1. Click the green "Code" button on this repository. Download ZIP. Unzip folder.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
3. Click "Developer Mode" (top right) so you can install custom extensions
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the unzipped folder from step 1.
5. Open `src/inject/inject.js` and update line 2 with an emoji of your choice (instructions below)

Then, open Discord. Go to a channel. You should see a sea of emojis as soon as the chat loads.

# HOW DO I CHOOSE AN EMOJI?!?

For now, the emoji you choose has to be under "Frequently used". This will hopefully be fixed in a future version.

1. Open src/inject/inject.js
2. Change `green_square` on line 2 to your emoji of choice

Sometimes emojis have multiple names. In that case, update line 2 with the first name that appears in the Add Reaction search bar. For instance, ü§ù is `:handshake: :shaking_hands:`, so we set line 2 to:

`const EMOJI_NAME = "handshake";`
